# LaserDrawing
MaxMSP Patches created to prototype my live Laser Drawing show and workshops from 2016 (more info @ https://vimeo.com/jestern, or snippets here: https://www.instagram.com/_jestern_/)

1) get a laser (chep ones from Laserworld)
2) make an ILDA to 5 minijacks custom cable
3) use a multichannel soundcard (MOTU to be DC-coupled or another soundcard if you don't care) to output X, Y, R, G, B signals
4) use my software to create shapes
5) you can also try with a modular synth now or some custom electronics
5) send me a video :)

I will update slowly depending on time. They can be used to control Lasers or Vectrex modified monitors or any vector screen, e.g. Oscilloscopes.
I assume you are using a MOTU DC coupled soundcard, though these work with normal multichannel soundcards too (with DC removal).
