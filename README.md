# LaserDrawing
MaxMSP Patches created to prototype my live Laser Drawing show and workshops from 2016 (more info @ https://vimeo.com/jestern, or snippets here: https://www.instagram.com/_jestern_/)

I will update slowly depending on time. They can be used to control Lasers or Vectrex modified monitors or any vector screen, e.g. Oscilloscopes.
I assume you are using a MOTU DC coupled soundcard, though these work with normal multichannel soundcards too (with DC removal).
